 Set up the local puppeteer enviroment


 First, start Google Chrome with remote debugging enabled. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:
css
 
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

 This will start Google Chrome with remote debugging enabled on port 9222.

In your Node.js script, require the puppeteer-core package instead of puppeteer, since we want to connect to an existing instance of Google Chrome rather than launching a new one.
javascript -->

const puppeteer = require('puppeteer-core');


 Then, create a new Browser instance by calling the puppeteer.connect() method and passing in the browserWSEndpoint option with the remote debugging URL of the running Google Chrome instance:
javascript -->

const browser = await puppeteer.connect({browserWSEndpoint: 'ws://localhost:9222/devtools/browser/<session-id>'});


The <session-id> portion of the URL can be obtained by visiting the URL -->

http://localhost:9222/json/version

 Set up the Openai Nodejs Environment -->

using the OpenAI library in your Node.js project, you need to install the library using npm and configure your Node.js file.

Here are the steps to get started:

Open your project in a terminal or command prompt.

Run the following command to install the OpenAI library:-->

npm install @openai/api

Once the installation is complete, you can import the library in your Node.js file:

javascript-->

const { OpenAIApi } = require('@openai/api');

You also need to configure the library by creating an instance of the OpenAIApi class and providing your OpenAI API key:-->



const openai = new OpenAIApi('YOUR_API_KEY');



 Set up the Openai Nodejs Environment -->
